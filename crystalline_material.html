    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Materials exhibit a wide range of properties, which distinguish them from one another. These properties include brittleness, ductility, malleability, strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, and magnetic properties. The diversity in the properties of solid materials is a result of their unique structures. Understanding the structure of a solid material is crucial, as it directly influences its behavior and properties.</p>

    <h2>Classification of Solids</h2>
    <p>From the perspective of crystal structure, solid materials can be broadly classified into two categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crystalline Materials</li>
        <li>Non-Crystalline or Amorphous Materials</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Crystalline Materials</h2>
    <p>The materials in which the atoms are arranged in a systematic pattern (regular pattern) are known as crystalline materials. In these materials, the arrangement of atoms is in a periodically repeating pattern.</p>

    <h3>Single and Poly Crystalline Materials</h3>
    <p>The crystalline material is either a single crystal or poly-crystal. In single crystal, the entire material consists of only one crystal.</p>

        <figcaption>Fig. 1.1 Atomic arrangement: (a) single crystal (b) poly-crystal</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In poly-crystal material, a collection of many small crystals is separated by well-defined boundaries.</p>
    <p>The atomic arrangements of single crystal and poly-crystal are shown in Fig 1.1 (a) and (b).</p>
    <p>The crystalline materials are made up of either metallic crystals or non-metallic crystals.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Metallic crystals - Iron, copper, silver, aluminium, tungsten, etc.</p>
    <p>Non-metallic crystals - Crystalline carbon, germanium, silicon, crystallized polymers, etc.</p>
