# E-learning-Platform
Abstract:
Despite living in an era of unprecedented development, progress in the field of education has remained stagnant. For centuries, learning has primarily been centered around classrooms filled with students with a note in hand, listening to a teacher teaching based on their understanding, research, and occasional references to various authors. Nowadays, modern technologies like projectors, power points and online file directories have slowly made their way into mainstream education. However, their implementation has been unrefined. E-learning platforms have the potential to revolutionize education by effectively implementing these modern tools. 
This project aims to introduce a Cloud-based E-learning Platform designed to rethink the way learning takes place. It has the potential to bring about much-needed educational reforms, and offer a dynamic and accessible learning ecosystem that benefits both learners and educators alike.

Through this platform, we:
Offer Students personal profiles allowing them to pursue their individual interests, at a rate they are comfortable with. Teachers will get a separate account in order to monitor and teach from the sidelines.
Offer students access to online study materials, digital books, e-notes, and other resources through an E-library feature.
Overcome geographical and socio-economic constraints and ensure universal access to education. Using cloud technology, learners can access materials and learn from anywhere with internet connectivity, promoting inclusivity and lifelong learning opportunities.
