    <h1>About E-Learning System</h1>
    <p>Through this platform, we aim to:
        Offer students access to online study materials, digital books, e-notes, and other resources through an E-library feature.
        Provide video-based learning modules and enable real-time monitoring of learner progress. This allows the adjustment of course plans through data-driven insights based on individual performance rather than an entire class.
        Facilitate interaction with a question-and-answer feature, allowing learners to gain insights from the best teachers across the world, anytime and anywhere.
        Provide comprehensive test series and modules to assess the understanding of subjects and track proficiency over time.
        Improve organization and time management by offering a calendar function to schedule study sessions, and deadlines.
        Overcome geographical and socio-economic constraints and ensure universal access to education. Using cloud technology, learners can access materials and learn from anywhere with internet connectivity, promoting inclusivity and lifelong learning opportunities.</p>
